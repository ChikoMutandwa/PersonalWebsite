            <h1>About Chiko</h1>
            <p>
                Future software developer and systems analyst. I am a third-year student at Pearson institute of higher education (PIHE) studying a Bachelor of Science in information technology. I am a young software developer that enjoys more of object-oriented designing.
                I mostly enjoy object-oriented designs and designing systems architecture and how everything will link together in a system.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a type of person that is eager to learn more and more hence why I chose IT, because the world is developing, and IT is not static it grows each and every day. I see myself as forever being a student not that I will be in school for a long time, but
                even after my degree I will keep studying in order for me to be up to date with technology and the IT world. My hunger for IT has grown as I have gained more knowledge about IT in the industry and IT in general. Most of the projects I
                have worked on are mostly school projects, but I believe they are preparing me for the outside world.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now am going towards being a freelancer for the time being as I finish my degree and get a job. I am person who is always ready for a challenge, I like to test myself to the most for I believe it brings out the most. I am always striving to be the
                best in everything I do, for I believe that great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance.
